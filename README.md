# TelcoApp
 A project of the course DB2 from POLIMI
## Documentation
 The [documentation](docs/DB2presentation.pdf) describes the entire project and was written using [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project/628b5b626d2a03d1af670c3c).
## Deployment
 Follow the [guide](docs/DB2_SoftwareInstallationGuide_v4.pdf) to set up the tomeecat, install Eclipse, and import the 2 projects. To facilitate the process, I also added the server directory to import along the projects (if it helps).
## Usage 
 Once the server is started, get the website page; it should be pretty obvious how it works.
